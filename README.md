# PAC Docker Image

I hate managing passwords, let's start with that.
However, even if PAC is a great tool, it is old and outdated and doesn't install and bla bla bla...

Just use a Docker image with an immutable version of Debian and shut up.
This is the image repository

## Usage
Either `./run.sh` or create a `.desktop` file for it.
